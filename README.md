# The Mirror Game

## Under construction

The Mirror Game is a little logic game where you play with your reflection on a different road,
the goal is to make it to the finish line on both road

You can test it with the [Godot game engine](godotengine.org) or by getting the .exe file on release page (there ain't one yet), but remember it's still in alpha ;)
